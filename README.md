# TM4C123 RTOS Demo with QP/C (QXK + Semaphore + GPIO IRQ)

![Demo Screenshot or Board Photo](docs/board_photo.jpg)

A compact embedded RTOS example on the **EK-TM4C123GXL** (Cortex-M4F) using the **QP/C framework (QXK kernel)**.  
It demonstrates interrupt-based event signaling, thread synchronization via semaphores, and basic LED control.

## ðŸ›  Build & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Code Composer Studio (CCS)** or GCC ARM toolchain  
- **TivaWare SDK** (not included in repo)  
- **QP/C** is included under `QPC/` in this repo  

### Importing in CCS

1. **Import project**:
   - `File â†’ Import CCS Projects` â†’ point to repo root
2. **Include path setup**:
   - Add paths in Project Properties â†’ CCS Build â†’ GNU Compiler â†’ Directories:
     ```
     ${ProjDirPath}/Application
     ${ProjDirPath}/CMSIS/include
     ${ProjDirPath}/ek-tm4c123gxl
     ${ProjDirPath}/QPC/include
     ${ProjDirPath}/QPC/ports/arm-cm/qxk/gnu
     /path/to/TivaWare
     ```
3. **Linker script (if needed)**: select the one under `ek-tm4c123gxl` or your custom `.cmd`  
4. **Build and flash** â€” connect the LaunchPad, flash via CCS.
